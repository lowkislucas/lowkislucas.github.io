        At step 0 we look forward to focusing on the overall progression of a
        competitive gamer with mental health as the primary focus. Especially
        with multiplayer online video games becoming more popular, this has led
        to an increased problem in mental health where players often feel
        inadequate. Our organization looks to improve the approach and mentality
        of these players to ensure a more consistent, smoother and sustainable
        improvement in these video games.
