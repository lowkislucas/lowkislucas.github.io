      <h2>Why is Mental Health Important?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        In the age of the internet, mental health is becoming an increasingly
        relevant issue. Mental health is all encompassing in our lives and is
        connected to our emotional, psychological and social well-being. Mental
        health affects how we think, feel and live our lives.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Traditional mental health resources do not account for the rise of the
        internet and mental illness among young people. They are often slow,
        old, expensive and do not address the real problems in the internet age.

        <h3>Escapism</h3>
        <p>
          Video games are commonly used by many people across the world as a
          coping method which they use in order to temporarily escape from
          reality. This is because, especially with the advancement of
          technology, game developers are easily able to create virtual worlds
          that can replicate reality and can provide a great temporary escape.
          So already heading in, many gamers are at a disadvantage in terms of
          positive thinking.

      <div class="flex-paragraph">
        <h3>Toxicity</h3>
        <p>
          Now combine this with the rampant amount of toxicity and negative
          comments on the internet within the video games, this can and often
          lead to the mental health problem being heavily augmented. And
          although other competitive activities all have banter, the level of
          cyberbullying that occurs online is far higher than any other sport,
          as it is even uncommon to see hate speech being thrown around. This is
          due to the inability to regulate messages sent online.

        <h3>Addiction</h3>
        <p>
          Another reason why mental health problems are highly susceptible to
          gamers, is because like with all forms of escapism, this can lead to
          an addiction. For many, especially ones who are competitive gamers,
          find the comfort within their games and because their previous time
          investment feels much better returning to the game. However this is
          often problematic because the toxic environment they spend so much
          time in pushes towards their declining mental health creating a
          negative cycle.
