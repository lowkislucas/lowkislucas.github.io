        <h3>Take Breaks</h3>
        <p>
          The most important and best way to maintain good mental health is to
          take consistent breaks between gaming sessions. Often players
          experience deteriorating mental health (which often leads to bad
          performance in game) but continue to play the game which continuously
          makes the problem worse. To stop this, whenever you are feeling that
          the game has started to become a source of stress, take a step back
          and realize that taking a break can help. As for competitive games,
          taking a few day break is often beneficial towards resetting and
          starting from a fresh start. A misconception many players have is that
          they worry, taking a break will build rust and hinder their overall
          improvement, however this is often not the case as rust takes a lot
          longer than a few days to set in and on the optimistic side can pull
          players out of a rut.

        <h3>/mute all</h3>
        <p>
          As for in game, the best tool to reduce the mental health strain is to
          use the option “mute all”. This setting is called different things
          across different games however all games have an option to block
          incoming messages. Toggling this option can block out the negativity
          that is extremely prevalent within the video game. And although many
          would point to the fact that muting is a competitive disadvantage, the
          benefits far outweigh the negatives being able to play consistently
          and sustainably leads to overall smoother progression in skill than
          being burnt out from mental health problems.
